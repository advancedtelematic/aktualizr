= aktualizr

====
C++ reference implementation of https://github.com/advancedtelematic/rvi_sota_server[GENIVI SOTA] OTA update client.
====

The client is intended to be installed on devices that wish to receive OTA updates from a GENIVI-compatible OTA server.

The client is responsible for:

* Communicating with the OTA server
* Authenticating using locally available device and user credentials
* Reporting current software and hardware configuration to the server
* Checking for any available updates for the device
* Downloaded any available updates
* Installing the updates on the system, or notifying other services of the availability of the downloaded file
* Receiving or generating installation reports (success or failure) for attempts to install received software
* Submitting installation reports to the server

The client maintains the integrity and confidentiality of the OTA update in transit, communicating with the server over a TLS link. The client can run either as a system service, periodically checking for updates, or can by triggered by other system interactions (for example on user request, or on receipt of a wake-up message from the OTA server).

==== Mac support

On a Mac, building aktualizr with a link:https://brew.sh[brew] package manager standard installation is partially supported. You can install the necessary dependencies with brew as follows:

----
brew install asn1c boost cmake libarchive libsodium pkgconfig
----

=== Building

This project uses *git submodules*. To checkout the code:

----
git clone --recursive https://github.com/advancedtelematic/aktualizr
cd aktualizr
----

If you had an old checkout, forgot to include `--recursive` or need to update the submodules, run:

----
git submodule update --init --recursive
----

`aktualizr` is built using CMake. To setup your `build` directory:

----
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
----

You can then build the project from the `build` directory using Make:

----
make
----

You can also create a link:docs/deb-package-install.adoc[debian package]:

----
make package
----

To use CMake's link:https://ninja-build.org/[Ninja] backend, add `-G Ninja` to the first CMake invocation. It has the advantage of running all targets in parallel by default and is recommended for local development.

=== Running tests

Before checking in code, it must pass the following tests (along with their corresponding build targets):

- compilation of the main targets and tests without warning: `make` and `make build_tests`
- validation against the project's automatic formatting conventions: `make check-format` to run the check, `make format` to apply the transformation automatically
- absence of clang-tidy warning: `make clang-tidy`
- full test suite run: `make check` (test build included), `make test` (only run the tests)

The `qa` target includes all of these checks, including auto-formatting:

----
make qa
----

Note that, by default, the compilation and tests run in sequence and the output of failing tests is suppressed. To run in parallel, for example with eight threads, and print the output of failing tests, run this:

----
CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL=8 make -j8 qa
----

Some tests require additional setups, such as code coverage, HSM emulation or provisioning credentials (link:docs/credentials.adoc[credentials.adoc]). The exact reference about these steps is the link:scripts/test.sh[main test script] used for CI. It is parametrized by a list of environment variables and is used by our CI environments. To use it, run it in the project's root directory:

----
./scripts/test.sh
----

Note that it will run CMake itself in a dedicated build directory.

To get a list of the common environment variables and their corresponding system requirements, have a look at the link:Jenkinsfile[Jenkins Pipelines definitions] and the project's link:docker/[Dockerfiles].


=== Tags

Generate tags:

----
make tags
----

=== Building with Docker

Several Dockerfiles are provided to support building and testing the application without dependencies on your
local environment.

If you have a working docker client and docker server running on your machine, you can build and run a docker
image on the default environment with:

----
./scripts/run_docker_test.sh Dockerfile
----

It will start a shell session inside the container, running as the same UID/GID as on the host system, with
the current directory mounted as a docker volume. Any local code changes are then immediately in effect
inside the container and user/group permissions are compatible in the two environments.

Inside the container, the test suite with coverage can be run with:

----
TEST_WITH_COVERAGE=1 TEST_WITH_P11=1 TEST_WITH_STATICTESTS=1 ./scripts/test.sh
----

(see the content of link:Jenkinsfile[] and link:scripts/test.sh[] for more testing options)

Alternatively, link:scripts/run_docker_test.sh[] can directly run the test script:

----
./scripts/run_docker_test.sh Dockerfile \
                            -eTEST_WITH_COVERAGE=1 \
                            -eTEST_WITH_P11=1 \
                            -eTEST_WITH_STATICTESTS=1 \
                            -- ./scripts/test.sh
----

=== Developing and debugging with an OpenEmbedded system

By default OpenEmbedded builds fixed versions of software from a VCS using bitbake recipes. When developing Aktualizr itself it is useful to have a quicker edit-compile-run cycle and access to a debugger. The following steps will use OpenEmbedded to create a cross-compilation environment, then build inside that.

1. Add the following to local.conf:
+
----
TOOLCHAIN_HOST_TASK_append = " nativesdk-cmake "
----

2. Build the SDK:
+
----
bitbake -c populate_sdk core-image-minimal
----

3. That will create a self-extracting installer that can be copied to your development machine. Install it by executing this script (or a similarly-named one, depending on your environment):
+
----
./tmp/deploy/sdk/poky-sota-glibc-x86_64-core-image-minimal-core2-64-toolchain-2.2.2.sh
----

4. Execute this script (or something similar, depending on where you installed it) to update the environment to point to the cross compilers:
+
----
. /opt/poky-sota/2.2.2/environment-setup-core2-64-poky-linux
----
+
You may want to verify that `which cmake` returns something like this:
+
----
/opt/poky-sota/2.2.2/sysroots/x86_64-pokysdk-linux/usr/bin/cmake
----

5. Create a cmake build directory for this cross-compile:
+
----
mkdir build-cross
cd build-cross
cmake .. <options>
make aktualizr
----

The compiled 'aktualizr' executable can be copied to the remote system and run.

Aktualizr can be debugged remotely by exposing a port from the VM to development machine (the --gdb option to the https://github.com/advancedtelematic/meta-updater/blob/rocko/scripts/run-qemu-ota[run-qemu-ota script] in https://github.com/advancedtelematic/meta-updater[meta-updater] does this), then:

.On the target:
----
gdbserver 0.0.0.0:2159 ./aktualizr --config /usr/lib/sota/sota.toml --loglevel 0
----

.On the host:
----
$ gdb aktualizr
(gdb) target remote localhost:2159
----

In CLion the remote debugger is configured as follows:

image:docs/clion-debugger.png[CLion GDB configuration]

It is also possible to run it inside valgrind:

.On the target:
----
valgrind --vgdb=yes --vgdb-error=0 ./aktualizr --config /usr/lib/sota/sota.toml
vgdb --port=2159
----

Then connect the debugger as usual.

== Usage

=== Configuration

To run the aktualizr client, you will need to provide a toml-formatted configuration file using the command line option `-c` or `--config`:

----
aktualizr -c <path/configfile>
----

Additional command line options can be found in the code (see link:../src/aktualizr_primary/main.cc[]) or by running `aktualizr --help`. More details on configuring aktualizr can be found in link:docs/configuration.adoc[]. If you are using https://github.com/advancedtelematic/meta-updater[meta-updater], more information about configuring aktualizr in that environment can be found there.

=== Provisioning

If you intend to use aktualizr to authenticate with a server, you will need some form of provisioning. Aktualizr currently supports three methods of provisioning: link:docs/automatic-provisioning.adoc[automatic], link:docs/implicit-provisioning.adoc[implicit], and link:docs/hsm-provisioning.adoc[by using an HSM]. You can learn more about the credentials files used to support provisioning in link:docs/credentials.adoc[].

== Building (with) gRPC

Building the aktualizr branch with gRPC support will require you to install gRPC binaries and supporting development headers on your machine. The binary distribution lacks the necessary CMake macros, so a source build is required. Furthermore, the binary install from the sourcebuild that links to host binaries needs to be bootstrapped by a build which uses dependencies shipped as git submodules in the tree. Hence:

----
git clone --recursive git@github.com:grpc/grpc.git && cd grpc
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make && sudo make install
----

----
cd .. && rm -rf build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DgRPC_ZLIB_PROVIDER=package -DgRPC_CARES_PROVIDER=package -DgRPC_SSL_PROVIDER=package -DgRPC_PROTOBUF_PROVIDER=package -DgRPC_INSTALL=ON
make && sudo make install
----

You should then be able to build aktualizr against the gRPC library and headers that are now installed in the host. Currently, only Ninja builds are working, so from the aktualizr source folder:

----
mkdir build
cmake -GNinja ..
ninja
----
