====
C++ reference implementation of https://github.com/advancedtelematic/rvi_sota_server[GENIVI SOTA] OTA update client.
====

The client is intended to be installed on devices that wish to receive OTA updates from a GENIVI-compatible OTA server.

The client is responsible for:

* Communicating with the OTA server
* Authenticating using locally available device and user credentials
* Reporting current software and hardware configuration to the server
* Checking for any available updates for the device
* Downloaded any available updates
* Installing the updates on the system, or notifying other services of the availability of the downloaded file
* Receiving or generating installation reports (success or failure) for attempts to install received software
* Submitting installation reports to the server

The client maintains the integrity and confidentiality of the OTA update in transit, communicating with the server over a TLS link. The client can run either as a system service, periodically checking for updates, or can by triggered by other system interactions (for example on user request, or on receipt of a wake-up message from the OTA server).

== Security

This client, and the https://github.com/advancedtelematic/rvi_sota_server[GENIVI SOTA] project, is aligned with the https://uptane.github.io[Uptane] security framework for software updates. Full details and whitepapers can be found on their site.

=== Building

This project uses *git submodules*. To checkout the code:

----
git clone --recursive https://github.com/advancedtelematic/aktualizr
----

If you had an old checkout, forgot to include `--recursive` or need to update the submodules, run:

----
git submodule update --init --recursive
----

`aktualizr` is built using CMake. To setup your `build` directory:

----
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
----

You can then build the project from the `build` directory using Make:

----
make
----

You can also create a link:docs/deb-package-install.adoc[debian package]:

----
make package
----

=== Linting

Before checking in code, the code linting checks should be run:

----
make qa
----

This will reformat all the code with clang-format and run clang-check and the test suite. Please follow the https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html[Google C++ Style Guide] coding standard.

By default, the compilation and tests run in sequence and the output of failing tests is suppressed. To run in parallel, for example with eight threads, and print the output of failing tests, run this:

----
CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL=8 make -j8 qa
----

=== Tags

Generate tags:

----
make tags
----

=== Testing

To run the test suite:

----
make test
----

`make qa` will also run the test suite.

Some of the tests require provisioning credentials. For details of the credentials format, see link:docs/credentials.adoc[credentials.adoc]. Tests that require valid credentials are disabled by default. To enable them, set `SOTA_PACKED_CREDENTIALS` in the cmake GUI, by passing `-DSOTA_PACKED_CREDENTIALS=...` to cmake, or by editing `CMakeCache.txt` in the build directory.

=== Code Coverage

The project can be configured to generate a code coverage report. First, create a CMake build directory for coverage builds, and invoke CMake with the `-DBUILD_WITH_CODE_COVERAGE=ON` flag:

----
mkdir build-coverage
cd build-coverage
cmake -DBUILD_WITH_CODE_COVERAGE=ON ..
----

Then use Make from the `build-coverage` directory to run the coverage report:

----
make coverage
----

The report will be output to the `tests/coverage` folder in your `build-coverage` directory.

=== Building with Docker

A Dockerfile is provided to support building and testing the application without dependencies on your local environment. If you have a working docker client and docker server running on your machine, you can build a docker image with:

----
docker build -t advancedtelematic/aktualizr .
----

While the default Dockerfile image is usually the best one to use, you can select another one with the `-f <Dockerfile>` flag, e.g.:

----
docker build -t advancedtelematic/aktualizr -f Dockerfile.deb-stable .
----

Once your docker image is built, Aktualizr can be built and tested with:

----
docker run --rm -it advancedtelematic/aktualizr src/scripts/coverage.sh
----

The following command will get a shell to perform an interactive build, but note that your local working copy will not be synchronised with the Docker container. The recommended development workflow is perform local cmake builds, but passing `-v $(pwd):/aktualizr-local` to `docker run` is an alternative.

----
docker run --rm -it advancedtelematic/aktualizr
----

=== Developing against an OpenEmbedded system

By default OpenEmbedded builds fixed versions of software from a VCS using bitbake recipes. When developing Aktualizr itself it is useful to have a quicker edit-compile-run cycle and access to a debugger. The following steps will use OpenEmbedded to create a cross-compilation environment, then build inside that.

1. Add the following to local.conf:
+
----
TOOLCHAIN_HOST_TASK_append = " nativesdk-cmake "
----

2. Build the SDK:
+
----
bitbake -c populate_sdk core-image-minimal
----

3. That will create a self-extracting installer that can be copied to your development machine. Install it by executing this script (or a similarly-named one, depending on your environment):
+
----
./tmp/deploy/sdk/poky-sota-glibc-x86_64-core-image-minimal-core2-64-toolchain-2.2.2.sh
----

4. Execute this script (or something similar, depending on where you installed it) to update the environment to point to the cross compilers:
+
----
. /opt/poky-sota/2.2.2/environment-setup-core2-64-poky-linux
----
+
You may want to verify that `which cmake` returns something like this:
+
----
/opt/poky-sota/2.2.2/sysroots/x86_64-pokysdk-linux/usr/bin/cmake
----

5. Create a cmake build directory for this cross-compile:
+
----
mkdir build-cross
cd build-cross
cmake .. <options>
make aktualizr
----

The compiled 'aktualizr' executable can be copied to the remote system and run.

Aktualizr can be debugged remotely by exposing a port from the VM to development machine (the --gdb option to the run-qemu-ota script in meta-updater does this), then:

.On the target:
----
gdbserver 0.0.0.0:2159 ./aktualizr --config /usr/lib/sota/sota.toml --loglevel 0
----

.On the host:
----
$ gdb aktualizr
(gdb) target remote localhost:2159
----

In CLion the remote debugger is configured as follows:

image:docs/clion-debugger.png[CLion GDB configuration]

It is also possible to run it inside valgrind:

.On the target:
----
valgrind --vgdb=yes --vgdb-error=0 ./aktualizr --config /usr/lib/sota/sota.toml
vgdb --port=2159
----

Then connect the debugger as usual.

== Usage

Run the client and provide a yaml formatted configuration file using the commandline option -c or --config. The configuration file has to contain the OAuth2 server URL, the SOTA server URL, a valid clientID and according secret and a valid device UUID. See the example config file at config/config.yml.example. The client will use the clientID and according secret to get an OAuth2 token from the authorization server which is then used to send API requests to the SOTA server.

----
aktualizr -c <path/configfile>
----
