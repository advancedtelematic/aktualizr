/** @file rvi.h
 * @brief Remote Vehicle Interaction library.
 *
 * This file is responsible for exposing all available function prototypes and
 * data types for the RVI library.
 *
 * This is an initial prototype of the RVI library in C and is subject to
 * change. The intended use is to allow a calling application to connect to
 * remote RVI nodes, discover services, register additional services, and
 * invoke remote services.
 *
 *
 * The RVI library depends on the following libraries:
 *
 * C standard library: https://www-s.acm.illinois.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/index.html
 *
 * libJWT: https://github.com/benmcollins/libjwt/
 *
 * Jansson: http://www.digip.org/jansson/
 *
 * OpenSSL: https://www.openssl.org/
 *
 *
 * The RVI library does not currently use the following, but may include it for
 * future interopability with RVI Core nodes:
 *
 * mpack: http://ludocode.github.io/mpack/
