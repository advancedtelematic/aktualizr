== Running Aktualizr in development

The `sota-local.toml` configuration file sets the package manager to `PackageManagerFake`, which allows the installation process to be tested locally:

    # From the build directory
    mkdir sota-prov
    src/aktualizr_primary/aktualizr --config ../config/sota-local.toml

For VS code, there is a `launch.json` provided in the `.vscode` directory.  This assumes that the cmake build directory is `build`.

== Creating a temporary OSTree environment

Try the scripts available in the link:{aktualizr-github-url}/tests/ostree-scripts[tests/ostree-scripts] directory.

== Inspect stored info with aktualizr-info

The aktualizr-info tool can be used to dump information stored in the libaktualizr database. By default, it displays basic information such as storage type, device ID, primary ECU serial and hardware ID and provisioning status. Additional information can be requested with link:{aktualizr-github-url}/src/aktualizr_info/main.cc[various command line parameters].

== Valgrind and gdb

If the target application or test is running under valgrind, then gdb can still be connected to the process without stopping it.  First run `vgdb --port=2159` in a different shell on the same machine, then connect to it using `target remote localhost:2159` in gdb

==  Dumping SSL encrypted traffic

First fetch and build sslkeylog from https://github.com/cajun-rat/sslkeylog

Next copy aktualizr.service to /etc/systemd/system/aktualizr.service.
This will override the packages default config.

Now modify `/etc/systemd/system/aktualizr.service` and add the following lines:

```
Environment=SSLKEYLOGFILE=/var/sota/premaster.txt
Environment=LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libsslkeylog.so
```

Reload the config and restart

```
# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl restart aktualizr
```

The symmetric SSL keys will be logged in `/var/sota/premaster.txt`

Now capture a packet dump with tcpdump

```
sudo tcpdump tcp port 443 -w upload.pcap
```

Fetch both of these down. In wireshark preferences set ssl.keylog_file to point to premaster.txt. If your https traffic not on port 443, then add the port to http.ssl.port. Now open upload.pcap.

== Serve repo generated by uptane-generator

aktualizr can be tested against a dummy repository containing fake images.

First, generate a repository using link:{aktualizr-github-url}/src/uptane_generator/main.cc[uptane-generator] tool:

```
uptane-generator generate <repo_dir>
```

Then, serve the generated directory using a web server such as the link:{aktualizr-github-url}/tests/fake_http_server/fake_test_server.py[fake test server].

For more information about using uptane-generator, see the xref:uptane-generator.adoc[uptane-generator article].

Here is an example configuration for nginx:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name localhost;

    location / {
        try_files  $request_uri $request_uri;
    }
    location /director/manifest {
        try_files  $request_uri $request_uri;
        dav_methods  PUT;
    }

    root repo_dir/repo;
}
```

== Inject faults

See the xref:fault-injection.adoc[fault injection article] for more information.

== Developing and debugging with an OpenEmbedded system

By default OpenEmbedded builds fixed versions of software from a VCS using bitbake recipes. When developing Aktualizr itself it is useful to have a quicker edit-compile-run cycle and access to a debugger. The following steps will use OpenEmbedded to create a cross-compilation environment, then build inside that.

1. Add the following to local.conf:
+
----
TOOLCHAIN_HOST_TASK_append = " nativesdk-cmake "
----

2. Build the SDK:
+
----
bitbake -c populate_sdk core-image-minimal
----

3. That will create a self-extracting installer that can be copied to your development machine. Install it by executing this script (or a similarly-named one, depending on your environment):
+
----
./tmp/deploy/sdk/poky-sota-glibc-x86_64-core-image-minimal-core2-64-toolchain-2.2.2.sh
----

4. Execute this script (or something similar, depending on where you installed it) to update the environment to point to the cross compilers:
+
----
. /opt/poky-sota/2.2.2/environment-setup-core2-64-poky-linux
----
+
You may want to verify that `which cmake` returns something like this:
+
----
/opt/poky-sota/2.2.2/sysroots/x86_64-pokysdk-linux/usr/bin/cmake
----

5. Create a cmake build directory for this cross-compile:
+
----
mkdir build-cross
cd build-cross
cmake .. <options>
make aktualizr
----

The compiled 'aktualizr' executable can be copied to the remote system and run.

Aktualizr can be debugged remotely by exposing a port from the VM to development machine (the --gdb option to the https://github.com/advancedtelematic/meta-updater/blob/master/scripts/run-qemu-ota[run-qemu-ota script] in https://github.com/advancedtelematic/meta-updater[meta-updater] does this), then:

.On the target:
----
gdbserver 0.0.0.0:2159 ./aktualizr --config /usr/lib/sota/sota.toml --loglevel 0
----

.On the host:
----
$ gdb aktualizr
(gdb) target remote localhost:2159
----

In CLion the remote debugger is configured as follows:

image::img::clion-debugger.png[CLion GDB configuration]

It is also possible to run it inside valgrind:

.On the target:
----
valgrind --vgdb=yes --vgdb-error=0 ./aktualizr --config /usr/lib/sota/sota.toml
vgdb --port=2159
----

Then connect the debugger as usual.

== Bitbaking with debug symbols

For every binary you want to debug (executables and shared libraries alike) you need to add these two lines in the recipe:

```
INHIBIT_PACKAGE_DEBUG_SPLIT = "1"
INHIBIT_PACKAGE_STRIP = "1"
```

You also need to make it build with debug symbols, which is recipe-dependent. For aktualizr it means specifying

```
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

instead of Release. However, this method does not install the sources on the device, so it helps to open the source file on your host machine.
