// MC: This is a slightly altered copy of "generate-devicecert.doc" with wording that explains the process from the perspective of testing with a self-signed root cert.

Once you have created a self-signed root certificate, you can use it to generate and sign device certificates. You then install these certificates on your test devices. 

*Generate a test device certificate, follow these steps*

. Generate a UUID for the device, and make a directory for it:
+
[source,bash]
----
export SERVER_NAME=myservername
export DEVICES_DIR = DEVICES_DIR="./${SERVER_NAME}/devices" CWD="${PWD}"
export DEVICE_UUID=$(uuidgen | tr "[:upper:]" "[:lower:]")
export device_id=${DEVICE_ID:-${DEVICE_UUID}} device_dir="${DEVICES_DIR}/${DEVICE_UUID}"
mkdir -p "${device_dir}"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Replace `myservername` with the server name that you used to xref:generate-selfsigned-root.adoc[generate your root certificate] -- unless you actually used the placeholder suggestion `myservername` from that procedure.
====
. Generate a device certificate and public key, and sign it with the root CA that you created previously.
+
[source,bash]
----
include::example$start.sh[tags="genclientkeys"]
----

. Find out the address of the device gateway for your OTA Connect Account
+
You can get this address from the `credentials.zip` that you download from the OTA Connect Portal.
+
You need this address to get the internal root CA certificate of the device gateway. This certificate is also necessary to provision devices.

.. If you haven't done so already, xref:dev@ota-web::create-provisioning-key.adoc[download a provisioning key].
.. Extract the contents of the `credentials.zip` file to a local folder.
.. In that folder, look for the file `autoprov` and open it with a text editor.
+
You should see a URL that resembles the following example:
+
`https://946f68b8-13d2-4647-b335-5a48777b5657.tcpgw.prod01.advancedtelematic.com:443`
.. Make a note of this URL.

. Get the device gateway's root certificate with the following openssl command:
+
----
export device_gateway=<your-gateway-url> 
openssl s_client -connect ${device_gateway}:8000 -servername $device_gateway -showcerts | \
  sed -n '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > ${device_dir}/root.crt
----
+
Replace, the placeholder `<your-gateway-url>` with URL that you noted in the previous step.
+
. Make a note where the actual `$(device_dir)` is on your computer.
+
You can quickly get it with the command `echo $(device_dir)`. Your device directory should resemble the following example:
+
`myservername/devices/4e7cdc4f-b7dc-4fb0-900f-a237ba3e804c/`
. Once have noted your device directory, you can xref:enable-device-cred-provtest.adoc[install the test device certificate on the device].
