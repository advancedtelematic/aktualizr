{product-name} lets you easily manage OTA updates to embedded devices running custom-built Yocto images. This is a guide for building a simple Yocto image that you can run in Virtualbox or QEMU. This is a good way to get started if you don't know yet what hardware your project will use, or if you just want to try out the features of {product-name} without worrying about physical devices.

== Run the built image with QEMU

The build process creates disk images as an artefact. You can then directly run them with QEMU. (If you don't already have it installed, install it with `apt-get install qemu` or similar.) The meta-updater layer contains a helper script to launch the images:

----
../meta-updater/scripts/run-qemu-ota [image name] [mac address]
----

Both arguments are optional; image name defaults to `core-image-minimal`, and if a mac address isn't specified, a random one is generated.

.Persistent storage
****
By default, QEMU will run your image in snapshot mode, *discarding any changes you made* to the disk image as soon as it exits. If you want to have a persistent VM, you need to create an link:https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/QEMU#Overlay_storage_images[overlay storage image] in qcow2 format. The helper script can also manage this for you, making it easy to create an emulated fleet of devices:

----
../meta-updater/scripts/run-qemu-ota --overlay mydevice.cow
----

If the specified overlay image doesn't yet exist, it will be created first, or launched directly if it does exist.
****

You should see your new device appear in {product-name-short} shortly after it boots. It will generate a random name for itself during autoprovisioning; you can change the name later.
