== Installing aktualizr via debian package

Aktualizr makes .deb packages available via the https://github.com/advancedtelematic/aktualizr/releases[GitHub releases page]. Download and install the .deb package, for example:

----
sudo apt install ./aktualizr.deb
----

=== Setting up aktualizr

The debian package will install, enable, and start an `aktualizr` systemd service immediately after it's installed. However, there are some configuration steps that should be taken before the service starts. To use aktualizr with a server (i.e. https://github.com/advancedtelematic/ota-community-edition/[OTA Community Edition] or https://docs.ota.here.com[HERE OTA Connect]), you will need to download the provisioning credentials file provided by the server and place it at `/var/sota/sota_provisioning_credentials.zip`.

You can pass any other command-line arguments in this file, as well.

For security reasons, we recommend creating the `/usr/lib/sota/sota.env` file even if you aren't going to use it. The file should be owned by root, with `600` permissions.

=== Secondary ECUs

The debian package ships with a default secondary ECU configured. This acts like a dummy device, dropping whatever file you send it into `/tmp/demo-virtual-secondary/firmware.bin`.

=== Building the debian package

After following the main build setup steps, just `make package` instead of `make` to create a debian package from your current branch, for example:

----
git clone --recursive https://github.com/advancedtelematic/aktualizr
cd aktualizr
mkdir build
cd build
cmake  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DBUILD_DEB=ON ..
make package
----

=== Making a Release on github

The process for releasing a new version of aktualizr and updating the documentation is described link:release-process.adoc[here].
