In OTA Connect, all devices and software belong to one *user* login. However, you don't want to mix up test software and production software by creating them all under the same user.

In a proper production workflow, you'll need separate user logins to manage the different stages:

. A developer user such as "\dev@acme.com".
. A QA user such as "\qa@acme.com".
. A production user such as "\prod@acme.com".

These logins provide you with a convenient way of clearly separating your development, QA and production resources.
