= Running aktualizr with fault injection

To test the system in adverse conditions, it can be useful to make aktualizr fail in a controlled fashion.

link:https://blitiri.com.ar/p/libfiu/[libfiu] provides a framework to do that, and aktualizr supports a number of controllable fail points.

== Setup

libfiu needs to be installed on the target machine. For local compilation on a Debian-derived system, the distribution package can be used:

    apt install fiu-utils libfiu-dev

Fault injection must then be enabled at CMake configure time with the `-DFAULT_INJECTION=on` option (refer to general building instructions for more details).

`fiu-run` and `fiu-ctrl` can now be used on the newly compiled aktualizr binary to inject faults (refer to corresponding man pages).

For example, when using the fake package manager:

    fiu-run -c 'enable name=fake_package_install' aktualizr -c . once

Our wrapper script in `./scripts/fiu` can be used in place, with the added feature of passing strings in failinfo parameters.

Usage is as follow:

    ./scripts/fiu run -c 'enable name=fake_package_install,failinfo=reason' -- aktualizr -c . once

== List of fail points

Please try to keep this list up-to-date when inserting/removing fail points.

- `fake_package_download`: force the fake package manager download to fail, optionally with a failure code supplied via `failinfo`
- `fake_package_install`: force the fake package manager installation to fail, optionally with a failure code supplied via `failinfo`
- `secondary_install_xxx` (xxx is a virtual secondary ecu id): force a virtual secondary installation to fail, optionally with a failure code supplied via `failinfo`
- `fake_install_finalization_failure`: force the fake package manager installation finalization to fail

== Use in unit tests

It is encouraged to use fail points to help unit testing sad paths. Tests that require fault injection should only be run if the `FIU_ENABLE` macro is defined.

== Example with a docker container

The aktualizr application docker image is compiled with fault injection support. It can be used as a quick way to simulate intermittent installation failures.

First build the image:

    ./docker/docker-build.sh

It will tag an image `advancedtelematic/aktualizr-app:latest` which includes the common aktualizr tools, as well as the fiu tools (`fiu-run`, `fiu-ctrl`...)

Then, prepare an environment for a simulated device, following the guide at link:https://docs.ota.here.com/quickstarts/install-a-client-locally-with-fake-secondaries.html[].

`aktualizr` will be run through docker instead of the local system, so all commands will start with:

    docker run -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -w $PWD -v $PWD:$PWD advancedtelematic/aktualizr-app

It runs the docker image inside a container with the same permissions as the local user, with a volume mounted in the current local directory.

Then, let's launch aktualizr with `fiu-run`:

    docker run --name aktualizr-fiu --rm -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -w $PWD -v $PWD:$PWD advancedtelematic/aktualizr-app fiu run -- aktualizr -c .

You can try to install a package now, which will succeed. To make all subsequent installations fail with the reason "TEST_FAILURE", use:

    docker exec aktualizr-fiu fiu ctrl -c 'enable name=fake_package_install,failinfo=TEST_FAILURE' 1

To make installations succeed again:

    docker exec aktualizr-fiu fiu ctrl -c 'disable name=fake_package_install' 1
