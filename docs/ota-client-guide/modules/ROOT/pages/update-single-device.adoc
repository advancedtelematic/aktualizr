= Update a device with the sample software

Once you've uploaded a few different software versions, you can try to push that software to a device that doesn't yet have the version installed. 

If you have more than one Raspberry Pi lying around, you could use the disk image that you created in the xref:build-raspberry.adoc[Raspberry Pi build instructions]. Flash that image to your second Raspberry Pi and boot it up. Otherwise, you could xref:build-quemu.adoc#_run_the_built_image_with_qemu[start another QEMU instance] based on the same disk image but with a different mac address. 

After your second device boots, it should automatically provision with OTA Connect.

* Log in to the xref:https://connect.ota.here.com[OTA Connect Portal] and check that second devices shows up in the last of mostly recently provision devices.

This list appears on the Dashboard that you see after you log in. If you see your second device, you're ready to send it an update.
