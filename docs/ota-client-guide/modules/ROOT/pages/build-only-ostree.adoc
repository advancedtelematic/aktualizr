You can select specific tasks to run with the `-c` option in bitbake. To build and push an image without generating the SD card images, you can do

    bitbake core-image-minimal -c image_garagecheck

NOTE: This will leave one artifact behind: a bzipped copy of the filesystem tree that gets committed to the OSTree repo. This can safely be deleted, however.
