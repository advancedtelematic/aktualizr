== U-Boot loading the wrong config file

U-Boot finds its initial configuration file by looping through the partitions in order and searching for `uEnv.txt` first in `/`, then in `/boot/`. If U-Boot isn’t loading the correct initial file, you should check the partitions layout, and see if there’s a vendor-provided `uEnv.txt` in a partition that comes physically before the one you’ve placed the OSTree initial `uEnv.txt`.


== Vendor's environment setup script overrides values that meta-updater has set.

Values specified in `local.conf` have the highest priority in a Yocto build. Most vendors provide a setup script for the build environment that also generates a `local.conf` with many values pre-populated. In some cases, those values can conflict with changes that the meta-updater makes.


For the LS1043ARDB, the environment setup script added a line to the `local.conf` that overrode the `INITRAMFS_IMAGE` value. To fix this, you need to specify the correct value in your `local.conf` when you build:
[source,bash]
----
INITRAMFS_IMAGE = "initramfs-ostree-image"
----

== Further Information

Building an integration with a new board involves dealing with several different systems. See the following links for more information on this:
