* *Use shared-credential provisioning for your devices*
+
With shared-credential provisioning, you don't have to worry about installing certificates on your devices. 

* *Build disk images using our demo recipes*
+
Use our demo build recipes to build an OTA-enabled disk images or simulate a device on your workstation.

* *Use the standalone aktualizr client to test the OTA functionality*
+
Aktualizr actually part of our demo build recipes and is included in the disk images that you'll build.

COMMENTING OUT UNTIL ORGANIZATIONS FEATURE STOPS BEING "ALPHA"
* *Set up different organizations*
+
In OTA Connect, all devices, software, and user accounts belong to an *organization*. Users can see all devices and software for their organization. However, you don't want to mix up test software and production software.
+
In a proper production workflow, you'll need separate organizations to manage the different stages:
+
. A developer organization such as "acme-dev".
. A QA organization such as "acme-qa".
. A production organization such as "acme-prod".
+
A user can belong to multiple organizations, and it's easy to switch between them. This provides you with a convenient way of separating your development, QA and production resources.

// DEVELOP

* *Set up provisioning with device credentials*
+
The term *device-credential provisioning* refers to the process of installing device certificates yourself rather than having the OTA Connect server install them automatically.

* *Set up different user accounts*
+
Avoid mixing up test software and production software by creating them all under the same user.

* *Use offline keys to sign software metadata*
+
Move the most important private keys from the server and take them offline.

* *Integrate libaktualizr with the client software on your board*
+
When you move to production, you'll want to integrate OTA functionality into your board's native software.
