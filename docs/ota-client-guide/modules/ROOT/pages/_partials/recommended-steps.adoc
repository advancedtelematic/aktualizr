* *Use shared credential provisioning for your devices*
+
With shared-credential provisioning, you don't have to worry about installing certificates on your devices.
The OTA Connect server automatically does this for you. All you need to do is download a provisioning key, unique to your account, and all your devices can share it.

* *Build disk images using our demo recipes*
+
We support a couple of demo boards "out of the box". You don't need to worry about complex build configurations at this stage. Just follow one of our xref:getstarted::start-intro.adoc[Get Started guides] to learn how to build an OTA-enabled disk image.
* *Use the standalone aktualizr client to test the OTA functionality*
+
You don't need to do anything extra to use the standalone aktualizr client. It's actually part of our demo build configurations, so the aktualizr client is included in the disk image that you'll build.
+
If you prefer to simulate an OTA-enabled device without building a disk image, you can install the aktualizr client on your development computer. In this case, however, you won't be able to try out OSTree functionality--the client will simply download and verify binaries, dropping them into a configurable location on your filesystem.

* *Set up different user logins*
+
In OTA Connect, each user account gets its own personal software repositories and device inventory. However, you don't want to mix up test software and production software by putting all of your builds and devices on the same account.
+
A better strategy for production is to create separate user logins to manage the different stages. For example, you might want a three-step process:
+
. A developer user such as "dev@acme.com".
. A QA user such as "qa@acme.com".
. A production user such as "prod@acme.com".
+
These logins provide you with a way of clearly separating your development, QA and production resources.

COMMENTING OUT UNTIL ORGANIZATIONS STOPS BEING "ALPHA"
* *Set up different organizations*
+
In OTA Connect, all devices, software, and user accounts belong to an *organization*. Users can see all devices and software for their organization. However, you don't want to mix up test software and production software.
+
In a proper production workflow, you'll need separate organizations to manage the different stages:
+
. A developer organization such as "acme-dev".
. A QA organization such as "acme-qa".
. A production organization such as "acme-prod".
+
A user can belong to multiple organizations, and it's easy to switch between them. This provides you with a convenient way of separating your development, QA and production resources.

* *Start using device-credential provisioning for your devices*
+
The term *device-credential provisioning* refers to the process of installing or generating a unique X.509 certificate on each device _before_ adding it to your OTA Connect account, instead of having OTA Connect generate the certificate for each device after it registers.
+
Although it's convenient to use shared-credential provisioning so that the OTA Connect server manages the whole process, using shared-credential provisioning means that a private key gets transmitted from the OTA Connect server to each vehicle. For automotive-grade security, most large fleet owners will want to use a TPM or other type of hardware security module, so that the vehicle's private key material never has to exist outside of the vehicle.
+
In the initial integration phase you might not have the TPM/HSM ready to use, but you can still start using device-credential provisioning, using a self-signed certificate and loading signed device certificates onto your test devices using our tooling and instructions.

* *Use offline keys to sign software metadata*
+
Strong, automotive-grade security using Uptane is one of the most important parts of OTA Connect. Uptane achieves its security benefits by using multiple different, interdependent roles and repositories to sign software, establish trust, and ensure other important security properties. For a truly secure Uptane deployment, the keys that are used to sign metadata should be kept offline--for example, on a hardware security module like a Yubikey. To save you from the difficulties and complications of managing offline keys, new OTA Connect accounts start off by using online signing keys kept in secure storagefootnote::[Using HashiCorp's https://www.vaultproject.io/[Vault], an industry-standard best practice.]. When you upload software and disk images to OTA Connect, the server generates and signs the associated metadata for you.
+
During the integration phase, you should take the signing keys offline and rotate them. This puts you in complete control over your fleet's security--even if an attacker somehow compromised the entire OTA Connect infrastructure, they still wouldn't be able to install their software on your vehicles.
+
For the integration phase, it's fine if you keep these keys on your development computer. Later, you'll want to keep these keys somewhere more secure.

* *Start customizing the update client*
+
Most production use cases will have unique requirements that aren't met by the stock aktualizr app. With libaktualizr, the C++ library used to build aktualizr, you can customize every step of the installation process. Some examples of what you can do:
* Hook into an HMI system to ask for user confirmation before installing an update
* Check for safety conditions in the vehicle before starting an update
* Only download large updates when the vehicle is connected to WiFi, or at off-peak times
* Pass an update for a secondary ECU off to a custom UDS flashing tool
+
To prove you with some inspiration, we've created a demo app that integrates libaktualizr, along with a Yocto layer to integrate it.

//  end::integrate-steps[]

//  tag::deploy-steps[]

* *Set up full device-credential provisioning for your devices*
+
At this point you should have your own fleet root certificate which you register with the OTA Connect server under your production login.
+
You should ideally have an automated process to sign your device certificates and install them on your disk images before they flashed to the target boards.
+
You should also have an automated build process to build OTA-enabled images that also have device-credential provisioning enabled.


* *Create offline keys for production to sign software metadata*
+
This step is not that different from the equivalent step during the integration phase:
+
** During the integration phase, you generated a set of private keys with your *development* credentials.
** This time, you should generate another set with your *production* credentials.
+
You should keep these keys on a secure storage medium such as a link:https://www.yubico.com/[YubiKey]. You would only plugin your YubiKey when you need to sign metadata on your local computer.

* *Integrate libaktualizr with the client software on your board*
+
Once you understand how to the libaktualizr demo application works, you'll want to build a fully-functional integration with your board's software.

* *Build and cross-deploy your disk images to your production account*
+
After you've finished integration and development, you'll need to move disk images from one account to another. For example, you might want to send a development build that you’re happy with to the QA team, or send that build to the deployment team once it’s passed QA.
