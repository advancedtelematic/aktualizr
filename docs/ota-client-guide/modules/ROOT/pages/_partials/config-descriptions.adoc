If you are building a disk image that contains aktualizr, your configuration will be the **local.conf** file.

* You'll find this file in the `conf` subdirectory of the of your build project.

For more information, see the xref:build-configuration.adoc[build configuration reference] and the xref:build-images.adoc[sample build procedures]

//  end::buildconfig-hint[]

//  tag::clientconfig-hint[]
If you are running standalone aktualizr, your configuration file will be a *.toml* file.

You configure aktualizr by creating and updating a `*.toml` file in one of the following directories:

* `/usr/lib/sota/conf.d`
* `/etc/sota/conf.d/`

For more information and links to sample configuration files, see the xref:ota-client::aktualizr-config-options.adoc[client configuration reference].

//  end::clientconfig-hint[]

//  tag::pollconfig-dev[]
Interval between polls (in seconds).

The default polling internal designed to make it convenient for you test and develop OTA update functions.

//  end::pollconfig-dev[]

//  tag::autorebootconfig-dev[]
Forces installation completion. Causes a system reboot when using the OSTree package manager. Emulates a reboot when using the fake package manager.

You may want to enable this option for convenience during development.

//  end::autorebootconfig-dev[]

//  tag::pollconfig-prod[]
When moving to production you'll want to have a much longer interval.
In fact, for production, we don't support intervals less the 1 hour (3,600 seconds). Longer internals help you to reduce the internet bandwidth and power consumption for your devices.

We recommend an internal between 1 and 7 days (86,400 to 604,800 seconds)

//  end::pollconfig-prod[]

//  tag::autorebootconfig-prod[]
If you followed our recommendation to enable automatic rebooting for development, you should disable again for production.

//  end::autorebootconfig-prod[]


//  tag::metadata-expires[]
Use this option to have the metadata expire after a fixed date and time.

Specify the time as a UTC instant like in the following example:

//  end::metadata-expires[]

//  tag::metadata-expireafter[]
Use this option to have the metadata expire after an elapsed period of time.

Specify the number of years, months and days like in the following example:

//  end::metadata-expireafter[]
