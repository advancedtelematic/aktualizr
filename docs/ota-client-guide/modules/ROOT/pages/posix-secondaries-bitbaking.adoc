= Posix Secondaries: bitbaking and usage of Primary and Secondary images
:build-qemu-link: xref:build-quemu.adoc[How to build 'core-image-minimal' image for QEMU]]

The goal of this doc is to guide a reader on bitbaking of two type of images `primary` and `secondary` that are targeted for QEMU or RPi
and running of which on the target makes it act as `Primary` and `Secondary` ECU of a single device.

Refer to link:https://uptane.github.io/uptane-standard/uptane-standard.html[the Uptane standard] in order to grok the meaning of the `Primary` and `Secondary` terms in the given context from a theoretical standpoint.
Check out xref:posix-secondaries.doc[this doc] to understand these terms from a practical standpoint and
to learn how `Primary` and `Secondary` can be emulated locally on an user's host.
It is highly advisable to follow the doc instructions and play with emulated `Primary` and `Secondary` prior to running steps described further in this doc.

== Bitbaking

It is assumed that a reader is familiar with Yocto and bitbaking in general as well as bitbaking of Aktualizr images in particular,
details of which are out of scope of this doc and can be found in the following guides:

* link:https://github.com/advancedtelematic/meta-updater/blob/master/README.adoc[meta-updater README].
* 

=== Primary
To bitbake an image for `Primary` run the following:
....
bitbake primary-image
....


.Primary configuration variables
[cols="1,1,10"]
|===
|Name |Default |Description

|`PRIMARY_IP`
|`"10.0.3.1"`
|An IP address to assign to one of the Primary's NIC for communication with Secondaries

|`PRIMARY_PORT`
|`"9040"`
| A TCP port that Primary aktualizr listen on for connections from Secondaries

|`PRIMARY_WAIT_TIMEOUT`
|`"120"`
|Time (seconds) to wait for connections from Secondaries. Only the secondaries that connected to Primary will be registered at the server and are part of the device Primary represents.

|`PRIMARY_SECONDARIES`
|`"10.0.3.2:9050"`
| A space separated list of TCP/IP addresses of the Secondaries to be included into the list of ECUs served by the given Primary
|===

Note that PRIMARY_SECONDARIES can be a list of TCP/IP addresses in order to fulfill multiple secondaries use case.
For example, `PRIMARY_SECONDARIES = "10.0.3.2:9050 10.0.3.3:9050 10.0.3.4:9050"`.


=== Secondary
To bitbake an image for `Secondary` run the following
....
bitbake secondary-image
....

.Secondary configuration variables
[cols="1,1,10"]
|===
|Name |Default |Description

|`SECONDARY_IP`
|`"10.0.3.2"`
|An IP address to assign to A Secondary NIC for communication with Primary

|`SECONDARY_PORT`
|`"9050"`
|A TCP port that Secondary listen on for connections from Primary
|===

==== Multiple secondaries use case
In order to support multiple secondaries use case an user should

* repeat the secondary bitbaking procedure corresponding number of times, each time
** specifying unique TCP/IP address by means of `SECONDARY_IP` and `SECONDARY_PORT` configuration variables
** copying and naming uniquely the resultant image file (e.g. `cp tmp/deploy/images/qemux86-64/secondary-image-qemux86-64.ota-ext4 secondary-images/secondary-image-qemux86-64.ota-ext4-001`)
* bitbake the primary image with `PRIMARY_SECONDARIES` listing the corresponding secondaries TCP/IP addresses
* run the primary by following the guide in <<Running>>
* run the secondaries by running the command specified in <<Running>> with a parameter pointing to corresponding secondary image.
For example,

`../meta-updater/scripts/run-qemu-ota --no-gui --secondary-network secondary-images/secondary-image-qemux86-64.ota-ext4-001`

`../meta-updater/scripts/run-qemu-ota --no-gui --secondary-network secondary-images/secondary-image-qemux86-64.ota-ext4-002`

=== Specifics of bitbaking for Raspberry Pi

It is assumed that a reader is a familiar with bitbaking for Raspberry Pi in general, see xref:build-raspberry.adoc[Build a Raspberry Pi image].

The aforementioned/above guide is relevant and applicable to building a Raspberry images of Primay and Secondary.
The following is specifics of building such images targeting RPi.

* run `source meta-updater/scripts/envsetup.sh raspberrypi3` to get the build environment set up from a root of the yocto project (updater-repo)
* specify type of NIC to use for Primary for connection to Internet/backend. There are two options, ethernet NIC or Wifi.
By default ethernet NIC is used which implies that Raspberry Pi is connected to LAN with an access to Internet. To use WiFi NIC the following configuration variables should be defined in your local configuration (local.conf):

.WiFi configuration variables
[cols="1,7,10"]
|===
|Name |Default |Description

|`RPI_WIFI_ENABLE`
|`"0"`
|A flag to enable/disable (default) WiFi on RPi board.

|`RPI_WIFI_SSID`
|`N/A (mandatory if wifi is enabled)`
|SSID of a WiFi network to connect to. The SSID is case sensitive.

|`RPI_WIFI_PWD`
|`N/A (mandatory if wifi is enabled)`
|Password to connect to the WiFi network router.

==== RPi networking details in a context of Posix secondaries support

IP/Posix secondaries support implies that a single primary ECU connected to two IP networks:

* an IP network with an access to Internet for communication with the OTA backend;
* an IP network that does not have access to Internet for communication with secondary ECU(s). The secondaries should be connected to this internal network.

Taking into account that RPi has two NICs, ethernet and wifi the aforementioned requirements to networking can be fulfilled by applying the following approaches.

===== Primary uses multihomed ethernet interface, Secondary uses ethernet interface

Both primary and secondary ECUs has wifi turned off and are connected to the same LAN (via switch or router) that has an access to Internet.
Primary only network interface is configured in such way that it has two IP addresses assigned to it.

The first one (10.0.3.1 by default) is statically defined (can be configured via `PRIMARY_IP` configuration variable)
and connects the primary to an internal IP network (10.0.3.0/8) that is aimed for communication with secondary ECU(s).
Secondary(ies) are connected to the same internal network (10.0.3.0/8) by assigning to their
ethernet interface corresponding IP addresses (10.0.3.x, 10.0.3.2 for the default only secondary, `SECONDARY_IP` configuration variable).

The second IP address assigned to the primary ethernet NIC should be obtained from a DHCP server running on one of
the devices (usually a router) that is connected to the given LAN, has an access to Internet and provides each host connected to the given IP network with access to Internet
(via NATing IP packets, DHCP and NAT server can be hosted/running on different devices).

The given networking option is enabled by default.

===== Primary uses both wifi and ethernet interfaces, Secondary uses ethernet interface
Primary has wifi on, and its wifi NIC is connected to a LAN with an access to Internet. Also, Primary ethernet NIC
is assigned with an only IP address (10.0.3.1 by default) to connect to the internal network for communication
with secondary ECUs.
Secondary(ies) are connected to the same internal network (10.0.3.0/8) by assigning to their
ethernet interface corresponding IP addresses (10.0.3.x, 10.0.3.2 for the default only secondary, `SECONDARY_IP` configuration variable).

===== Primary and Secondary uses wifi, only Primary uses ethernet NIC
In this case, both Primary and Secondary(ies) uses wifi NIC to connect to the internal network (wifi router should not have an Internet access). Secondary doesn't use ethernet NIC.
Primary connects to Internet via ethernet NIC that should be connected to LAN with an access to Internet.
`(The given approach is not supported by the meta-updater but can be applied by an advanced user)`


== Running

It is assumed that a reader is familiar with details on running of bitbaked images targeted for QEMU, such information can be found in the following docs:

* link:https://github.com/advancedtelematic/meta-updater/blob/master/README.adoc[meta-updater README].
* xref:build-quemu.adoc[How to build 'core-image-minimal' image for QEMU]]

=== Primary

To launch QEMU VM acting as Primary run the following from your build directory
....
../meta-updater/scripts/run-qemu-ota --no-gui --secondary-network primary-image
....
`--secondary-network` option instructs QEMU to add NIC to the VM in order to communicate with Secondary VM(s) via it.


=== Secondary

To launch QEMU VM acting as Secondary run the following from your build directory
....
../meta-updater/scripts/run-qemu-ota --no-gui --secondary-network secondary-image
....
`--secondary-network` option instructs QEMU to add NIC to the VM aimed for communication with Primary

== Usage

Once both Primary and Secondary VMs are running you should see that a new device has been registered at the server and you can start testing it.
The following are Tips & Tricks for using & troubleshooting of the Primary and Secondary VMs.

* run `journalctl -f -u aktualizr` to see logs that are being output by aktualizr running on `Primary` VM;
* run `journalctl -f -u aktualizr-secondary` to see logs that are being output by aktualizr-secondary (posix/IP secondary) running on `Secondary` VM;
* By default, both aktualizr and aktualizr-secondary are running as systemd services. Use `systemctl stop|start|restart <aktualizr|aktualizr-secondary>` to control aktualizr and aktualizr-secondary daemons/services managed by systemd;
* To control aktualizr|aktualizr-secondary manually stop corresponding systemd service (see above) and run it from command line:
just type `aktualizr' | `aktualizr-secondary`;
* By default, both executables output logs of level 1 (INFO), specify log level 0 in their config to see debug logs.
In case of running from command line add corresponding parameter `<aktualizr|aktualizr-secondary> --loglevel 0`.
In case of running as a systemd service add corresponding configuration fragment into /etc/sota/conf.d/ folder,
e.g. `echo -e "[logger]\nloglevel = 0" > /etc/sota/conf.d/50-debug-logs.toml` and restart the service;
* In order to trigger a device re-provisioning, please, remove the DB file on Primary, i.e. `rm /var/sota/sql.db`
* If the DB file is removed on Secondary then the device should be re-provisioned (see above),
otherwise Primary/aktualizr will refuse to work with a 'new' secondary as it will have a "new" autogenerated ECU serial
that doesn't the one already been registered on Primary.
* OTA Connect does not support adding/removing secondary ECUs to a device that has been already registered.
Thus adding a new ECU to the list of secondaries on Primary won't take much effect,
the new ECU won't appear on the UI and it will be listed as not registered by aktualizr-info.
