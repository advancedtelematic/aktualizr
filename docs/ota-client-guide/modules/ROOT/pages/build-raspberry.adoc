{product-name} lets you easily manage OTA updates to embedded devices running custom-built Yocto images. This is a guide for building a simple Yocto image for the {device}. You can use it as a base image for another project, or as a template for how to get started. The whole process only takes about 3 minutes of your time.

== Prerequisites

You'll need a build machine with the following:

* A x86-64 Linux distro link:https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.6/ref-manual/ref-manual.html#detailed-supported-distros[supported by the Yocto project] with the link:https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.6/ref-manual/ref-manual.html#required-packages-for-the-build-host[required packages] installed.
** On a Debian-based system, you should be able to install all the required packages with the following command:
+
----
sudo apt install gawk wget git diffstat unzip texinfo gcc-multilib build-essential chrpath socat cpio python python3 python3-pip python3-pexpect python-dev xz-utils debianutils iputils-ping cpu-checker default-jre parted
----
** Many/most distros that aren't on the officially supported list will still work just fine--feel free to give it a try with whatever you're running.
* 100GB+ of free disk space
* 6GB+ of RAM
ifeval::["{machine}" == "qemux86-64"]
* QEMU--we recommend installing it from your distro's package manager, e.g. `sudo apt install qemu`
endif::[]
* link:https://android.googlesource.com/tools/repo/[repo]
** link:https://source.android.com/source/downloading#installing-repo[Download the latest version] directly from Google, or
** install it from your distro's packages if available (`sudo apt install repo`)

TIP: It's possible use a virtual machine running Linux as your build machine. However, we don't recommend it. It will be slower, and you're more likely to run into difficult-to-troubleshoot issues. If you do want to use a VM despite this warning, though, make sure the VM has enough resources allocated to it. Along with the disk space and memory requirements above, we suggest allocating at least 4-6 CPU cores to the VM to speed up building.

Also, make sure that you've generated your xref:generating-provisioning-credentials.adoc[provisioning credentials] first.

== Create your Yocto build environment

First, clone a manifest file for the quickstart project:

----
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
repo init -u https://github.com/advancedtelematic/updater-repo.git -m zeus.xml
repo sync
----

This downloads the basic Yocto layers you need.

.What is this actually doing?
****
Yocto is a set of tools, templates and methods for building Linux systems from scratch. Most Yocto-built systems use a common set of base layers. The Yocto project maintains a *reference distribution* called Poky; we include that as a base layer, then add layers containing hardware support for specific boards (in this case the {device}). Finally, we include the *meta-updater* layer, which contains the platform-independent software the device and build system need to work with {product-name-short}, and *meta-updater-{meta-env}* for the device-specific code--mostly the specialized bootloader code.

All of these layers are assembled into a built Linux system by Bitbake, the build tool of the Yocto Project, based on the instructions in the recipes inside the layers.
****

Now you can run the following script to get the environment set up:

[subs=+attributes]
----
source meta-updater/scripts/envsetup.sh {machine}
----

// end::env-setup[]
// tag::config[]

== Customize your build

The environment setup script will have created a build directory and placed you in it. It also generates a configuration file, located at `conf/local.conf`. This file is where we'll make our modifications to the base config.

To connect with your {product-name} account, you'll need the provisioning credentials bundle you downloaded earlier. Add the following line to your local.conf to supply those credentials to the build:

----
SOTA_PACKED_CREDENTIALS = "/path/to/your/credentials.zip"
----

=== Optional configuration keys

* *Set image name*

When you build a filesystem image, it gets automatically uploaded to {product-name-short}. By default, the image will be named `{MACHINE}-ota`, and you'll see the various versions of the image under that name. You can also choose to set your own name as follows:

----
OSTREE_BRANCHNAME = "my-super-great-project"
----

* *Persistent Yocto shared state cache and download directory*

Yocto caches its build artefacts to speed up future builds. By default, these are stored under the build directory of the current project. However, if you're planning to build several different projects that have some shared base files, you might want them to share their cache directories, both to save space and speed up your builds. You can do that as follows:

----
SSTATE_DIR = "/path/to/your/shared-sstate"
DL_DIR = "/path/to/your/shared-download"
----

* *Add extra packages*

There are quite a lot of packages available to install that aren't installed by default. You can add extra packages to your image with *IMAGE_INSTALL_append*; for example, this will install vim:

----
IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " vim " <1>
----
<1> Note the spaces before and after the package name. This option dumbly appends a string to an install list, so we wrap it in spaces to make sure we don't alter the list in unexpected ways.

You can get a list of all the available packages in the layers you have configured with `bitbake-layers show-recipes`
// end::config[]
// tag::bitbake[]

== Bitbake

Now you're ready to build an image.

[subs=+attributes]
----
bitbake core-image-minimal
----

image::https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/compiling.png[float="left",align="center"]

This step will take a while. If you used the build mirror, it might be as little as 10-15 minutes. Building everything from scratch, it will likely take a few hours.

// end::bitbake[]

== Put the built image on an SD card

The build process creates disk images as an artefact. The one you need to write to the disk is located under your build directory at `tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi3/core-image-minimal-raspberrypi3.wic`. We provide a script to write the image and resize it to fit your SD card:

----
sudo ../meta-updater-raspberrypi/scripts/flash-image.sh <device> <1>
----
<1> <device> is the name of the the device you want to write to. For example, `sdb`.

TIP: You can also write the image using `dd`, but since the wrong kind of typo in a dd command is so dangerous, we don't recommend it. If you really want to do it that way, though, inspect the shell script to find the required commands.

Now, put the card into your Pi, plug it into a *wired* internet connection, and power it on. You should see it come online in a minute or two. It will generate a random name for itself during autoprovisioning; you can change the name later.
