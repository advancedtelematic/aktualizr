To create a new link:https://github.com/advancedtelematic/aktualizr/releases[release of aktualizr and garage-deploy], there are several discrete steps to follow:

toc::[]

== Update the changelog and other docs

This is normally a good time to update the link:https://github.com/advancedtelematic/aktualizr/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md[changelog]. Ideally, the changelog should be updated with the new release number before creating the release so that the packaged source code includes the correct information about the release. The easiest way to check the changelog is to review all PRs merged to master since the last release was made and to verify that any important changes that impact the user experience are reflected in the changelog.

There are a few additional documents that should be updated to refer to the new release:

* The link:https://github.com/advancedtelematic/aktualizr/blob/master/docs/README.adoc#reference-documentation[docs README] contains a table with links to the doxygen docs for each release.
* The xref:install-garage-sign-deploy.adoc[garage-deploy] installation guide contains a reference to the latest release of the garage-deploy Debian package.

== Pull in any new changes from the current docs branch

The docs published as https://docs.ota.here.com/ota-client/latest/index.html[latest] in the OTA Connect Developer Guide are built from the most recent release's docs branch (`\{version}-docs`). There will very likely be changes from there that have not been pulled into master yet. Open up a PR to merge the previous release's docs into master, resolving any merge conflicts as needed. Once that PR is merged, you can move on to the next step.

== Create a new tag

Releases are built automatically by gitlab from annotated tags of the form `major.minor`, where `major` and `minor` are numbers. We normally set `major` to the current year and `minor` to an incrementing number beginning at 1.

To create a release, checkout the revision you want to bless, then:

----
git tag -as <tag>   # e.g. git tag -a 2018.4
git push github <tag>
----

Gitlab will build this tag and automatically create a release for it on github.

=== Create a new docs branch

Create (and push to github) a new branch with the commit you just tagged as the parent:

----
git checkout -b <tag>-docs # e.g. git checkout -b 2019.63-docs
git push github <tag>-docs
----

== Update doxygen on github

To update the doxygen documentation for master on github, you will need to do something like the following:

1. In an aktualizr repo, run `make doxygen` (or `make docs`) in the build directory.
1. Clone a second aktualizr repo and run `git checkout gh-pages`.
1. In the second repo, run `git rm search/* *.css *.html *.js *.png *.map *.md5 *.png *.svg`.
1. Copy the contents of `<build_dir>/docs/doxygen/html` into the root of the second repo. (Something like `cp -a <build_dir>/docs/doxygen/html/* <second_repo>`.)
1. In the second repo, run `git add .`, `git commit -as`, and `git push`.
1. Wait a minute or two for github to refresh and render the files.

== Add doxygen pages for the new release on github

To add doxygen docs for a new tag, you will need to do something like the following:

1. Check out the tag or commit you wish to add (`git checkout 2018.63`, for example).
1. Clean out the build directory (to remove stale objects), then run CMake and doxygen again:
+
----
rm -rf build/*
cd build
cmake ..
make doxygen
----
+
1. Clone a second aktualizr repo and run `git checkout gh-pages`.
1. In the second repo, make a directory for the tag or commit you wish to add, i.e. `mkdir 2018.63`.
1. Copy the contents of `<build_dir>/docs/doxygen/html` into the directory you just created. (Something like `cp -a <build_dir>/docs/doxygen/html/* <second_repo>/2018.63`.)
1. In the second repo, run `git add 2018.63`, `git commit -as`, and `git push`.
1. Wait a minute or two for github to refresh and render the files.

== Update the description of the github release

Once the release is ready on github, it should be edited to include a link to the changelog and doxygen documentation for that particular release. You can use a previous release as a model of how to format these links.

== Update the Uptane fork of aktualizr

Uptane has a fork of aktualizr in link:https://github.com/uptane/aktualizr[their namespace]. It should be updated with the same version of aktualizr used to make the new release.

== Update the homebrew recipe for aktualizr

The https://github.com/advancedtelematic/homebrew-otaconnect/blob/master/aktualizr.rb[homebrew aktualizr recipe] should be updated with the new release. You'll need a mac, with homebrew installed, to do this.

. Edit the recipe on your local system with `brew edit aktualizr`, and replace the old version tag with the new one.
. Build it, and then bottle it:
+
----
brew rm aktualizr && \
brew install --build-bottle aktualizr && \
brew bottle aktualizr
----
+
This will create a bottle file named `+aktualizr--VERSION.mojave.bottle.tar.gz+`, and output a block of Ruby code that looks something like this:
+
----
  bottle do
    cellar :any
    sha256 "391bc242685d86fd4fc69d90d98e10a464e6feebca943d3f48f848615c898085" => :mojave
  end
----
. Rename the file, removing one of the dashes (i.e. `+mv aktualizr--2019.6.mojave.bottle.tar.gz aktualizr-2019.6.mojave.bottle.tar.gz+`). I don't know why the generated filename is always wrong, but it is.
. Add the renamed bottle file as an artifact to the release on the https://github.com/advancedtelematic/aktualizr/releases[aktualizr releases page].
. Replace the `bottle do` block in your local recipe with the generated block from step 2, and add the appropriate `root_url` directive.
. Test the recipe locally, including installing from the bottle: `brew reinstall --force-bottle aktualizr`.
. Open a PR on the https://github.com/advancedtelematic/homebrew-otaconnect[homebrew-otaconnect] repo to update the recipe with all your changes.

== Test the released Debian packages

Don't forget to test the resulting Debian packages manually!
