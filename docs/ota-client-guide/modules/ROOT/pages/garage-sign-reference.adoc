= Garage-sign commands and options
:type: The type of key that you want to create: Ed25519 or RSA.
:keysize: The length of the key that you want to create, in bits. RSA 2048/4096 and Ed25519 are supported.
:key-name-text: The base filename for your keys. Generated files will be named `<key-name>.sec` and `<key-name>.pub`.
:keys-path: The path where this executable will look for keys. By default, it is the `user-keys` directory in the directory that you specified with the `--home-dir` command.
:inplace: Modifies the input .json file directly. If this option is not specified, it outputs the signed metadata to stdout.
:length: The length of the target, in bytes.
:version: The version string of the target.
:sha-256: The hash of the binary. For OSTree images, it is the root hash of the target commit.
:hardware-ids: The types of hardware with which this image is compatible.
:expires: The metadata expiry date. It is a UTC instant, such as `2020-01-01T00:01:00Z`.
:expire-after: The expiration delay in years, months, and days (each optional, but in that order), such as `1Y3M5D`.
:force: Skips sanity checking. For example, allows to set a date in the past.
:format: The format of the target: [`ostree`\|`binary`]
:url: (Optional) An external URL where the binary can be downloaded.

You can use the `garage-sign` tool if you need to sign metadata about your software, as well as manage your software signing keys and root of trust. When you start using OTA Connect, we generate a root of trust and a signing key for you, and automatically sign software you upload. Later on, you can use `garage-sign` to rotate those keys, taking them completely offline to increase security.

In the reference below, find a list of commands and options that you can use.
