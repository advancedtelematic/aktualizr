If you already have a Yocto-based project that you want to update using {product-name}, you just need to do four things to get started:

1.  Clone the https://github.com/advancedtelematic/meta-updater[meta-updater] layer and add it to your https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.6/ref-manual/ref-manual.html#structure-build-conf-bblayers.conf[bblayers.conf].
2.  Clone a BSP integration layer (`meta-updater-$\{PLATFORM}`, e.g. https://github.com/advancedtelematic/meta-updater-raspberrypi[meta-updater-raspberrypi]) and add it to your conf/bblayers.conf. If your board isn't supported yet, you could write a BSP integration for it yourself. See the <<Adding support for your board>> section for the details.
3.  Set up your https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.6/ref-manual/ref-manual.html#var-DISTRO[distro]. If you are using "poky", the default distro in Yocto, you can change it in your conf/local.conf to "poky-sota". Alternatively, if you are using your own or a third-party distro configuration, you can add `INHERIT += " sota"` to it, thus combining the capabilities of your distro with meta-updater features.
4.  {app-url}/#/profile/access-keys[Create a provisioning key, window="_blank"] and add it to your local.conf.

You can then build your image as usual, with bitbake. After building the root file system, bitbake will then create an https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/adapting-existing/[OSTree-enabled version] of it, commit it to your local OSTree repo, and push it to OTA Connect. Additionally, a live disk image will be created (normally named `$\{IMAGE_NAME}.wic` e.g. `core-image-minimal-raspberrypi3.wic`).
