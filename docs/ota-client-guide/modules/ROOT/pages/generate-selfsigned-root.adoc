= Generate a self-signed root certificate

When you move to production, you'll need to register your fleet root certificate with OTA Connect server. This certificate needs to be signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

If you don't yet have your own CA certificate for signing device certificates, you can generate a self-signed certificate for testing.

// tag::install-root-ca[]

To generate a self-signed root certificate, follow these steps: ::
. Create a directory structure for the keys, and get some sample configurations for the certificates from the OTA Community Edition project:
+
[source,bash]
----
export SERVER_NAME=myservername
export SERVER_DIR="./${SERVER_NAME}" DEVICES_DIR="./${SERVER_NAME}/devices" CWD="${PWD}"
mkdir -p "$DEVICES_DIR" certs
for file in client.cnf device_ca.cnf server.ext client.ext server.cnf server_ca.cnf; do
  curl -o certs/$file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/advancedtelematic/ota-community-edition/master/scripts/certs/$file
done
----
+
Then, generate the key and cert using openssl on the command line:
+
[source,bash]
----
include::example$start.sh[tags="genserverkeys"]
----
+
This will create a `./${SERVER_DIR}/devices/` directory with the `ca.crt` certificate and a `ca.key` private key. Keep the private key safe and secure.
