{product-name} lets you easily manage OTA updates to embedded devices running custom-built Yocto images. It works great with Automotive Grade Linux, so building an AGL image is one easy way to get started. If your planned project is automotive, AGL is a great choice to start out with. Out of the box, {product-name} works with AGL builds for QEMU and Raspberry Pi Model 3.

// Most of the content here is the same as the Raspberry Pi instructions, so we re-use the chunks we can.

== Create your AGL Yocto build environment

=== Get AGL master manifest

First, clone a manifest file for AGL Electric Eel:

----
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
repo init -b eel -m default.xml -u https://gerrit.automotivelinux.org/gerrit/AGL/AGL-repo.git
repo sync
----

This will download the basic Yocto layers you need. Generally, HERE Technologies recommends using AGL's latest point release.

.What is this actually doing?
****
Yocto is a set of tools, templates and methods for building Linux systems from scratch. Automotive Grade Linux is a complete Linux distribution designed for in-car systems. It includes base system layers from Poky and OpenEmbedded, board support layers for popular automotive platforms, and quite a lot more.

All of these layers are assembled into a built Linux system by Bitbake, the build tool of the Yocto Project, based on the instructions in the recipes inside the layers.
****

=== Run environment setup script

Now you can run the following script to get the environment set up:

----
source meta-agl/scripts/aglsetup.sh -m <target-architecture> agl-demo agl-appfw-smack agl-sota <1>
----
<1> Where `<target-architecture>` is either `raspberrypi3` or `qemux86-64`.

IMPORTANT: Only `raspberrypi3` and `qemux86-64` will work out of the box. If you want to create an {product-name-short}-compatible build for one of the other architectures AGL supports, you'll need to write a BSP layer for that board. You can take the link:https://github.com/advancedtelematic/meta-updater-raspberrypi/tree/morty/recipes-bsp[Raspberry Pi BSP] as an example of what's needed. You can also link:mailto:otaconnect.support@here.com[contact us directly] to inquire about commercial development of BSP layers for specific boards.

== Put the built image on your device's boot media

The build process creates disk images as an artefact. The exact image you'll need will vary depending on the architecture you're building forfootnote:[For example, building the `agl-demo-platform` target for Raspberry Pi 3 creates an image at `build/tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi3/agl-demo-platform-raspberrypi3.wic`.], but it will be located in the `/tmp/deploy/images` directory under your build directory. We recommend using https://www.balena.io/etcher/[Etcher, window="_blank"] to write the image, or following the normal flashing procedure for your device if applicable.

TIP: You can also write the image using `dd`, but since the wrong kind of typo in a dd command is so dangerous, we don't recommend it.

You'll probably also want to resize the main partition to fill all of the space on the boot media:

----
sudo parted -s /dev/sdX resizepart 2 '100%' <1>
sudo resize2fs /dev/sdX2 <1>
----
<1> Where /dev/sdX is the device you wrote the image to.

You should now be able to boot your device and have it show up in your {product-name-short} account.
