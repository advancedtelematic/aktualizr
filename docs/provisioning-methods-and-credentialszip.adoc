= Provisioning methods and credentials.zip

If you're trying to work on integrating OTA Connect into your device build, it may be helpful to have a little bit of reference information on how the different provisioning methods work together, and exactly what components are inside `credentials.zip`.

== `credentials.zip` file format

The following files are present in credentials.zip:

// tag::credentials-table[]

[options="header"]
|======================
| Filename in zip | Purpose | Used by
| treehub.json | URL and OAuth2 authentication for treehub and Uptane repo | garage-sign, garage-push, garage-deploy
| client_auth.p12 | TLS client credentials for authentication with treehub | garage-push, garage-deploy
| autoprov_credentials.p12 | TLS client credentials that are required when provisioning devices with shared credentials | aktualizr, aktualizr-cert-provider
| autoprov.url | URL for provisioning server | aktualizr, aktualizr-cert-provider
| root.json | Initial Uptane root.json (for secure bootstrapping) | garage-sign
| targets.pub | Public key for offline Uptane image signing | garage-sign
| targets.sec | Private key for offline Uptane image signing | garage-sign
| tufrepo.url | URL to Uptane repository | garage-sign
|======================

// end::credentials-table[]

As you can see, the relevant files for the device itself are `autoprov_credentials.p12` and `autoprov.url`.

== Configuration options for provisioning with shared credentials

When provisioning with shared credentials, the process works as follows:

1. The user downloads a package that contains an initial provisioning key. This is installed on all devices and is only used to bootstrap the provisioning process.
2. When Aktualizr first runs on a device, it uses this key/certificate to make a request to the device gateway https API.  The server registers the new device and returns a PKCS#12 archive containing the real credentials for the device.
3. The device reads the root CA certificate and client certificate from this bundle.
3. The device uses this private key/certificate for all further communication with the server.

The following items are relevant for this process:

[options=header]
|===================
| Configuration option | Where it will come from
| Server URL | Read from credentials archive
| TLS key/cert/root CA | Read from credentials archive
| Device ID | Automatically generated by Aktualizr
| Uptane public/private key | Automatically generated by Aktualizr
| Uptane primary serial number | Automatically generated by Aktualizr
| Primary ECU Hardware ID | Automatically generated by Aktualizr
|===================

An example `.toml` configuration file can be found at link:../config/sota-shared-cred.toml[]. This is what is used by the `aktualizr-shared-cred-prov` recipe in meta-updater.

== Configuration options for provisioning with device credentials

When provisioning with device credentials, OTA Connect needs to get various certificates and keys from somewhere. This table summarizes what is needed, and where it comes from in the HSM.

// tag::summary-table[]

[options=header]
|===================
| Configuration option         | Where it will come from/what it does
| Server URL                   | Read from credentials archive
| Server Root CA cert          | Read from credentials archive
| Fleet Root CA cert           | Chain of trust for a device fleet; provided by the user. Must be uploaded by user to the server.
| Fleet Root CA private key    | Key for signing device certs in the fleet; provided by user, but used only for signing. Not stored on device.
| TLS device cert              | Pre-installed in the device HSM; must be signed by Fleet Root CA private key
| TLS device key               | Pre-installed in the device HSM
| Device ID                    | Read from Common Name field of TLS device cert
| Uptane public/private key    | Automatically generated by Aktualizr
| Uptane primary serial number | Automatically generated by Aktualizr
| Primary ECU Hardware ID      | Automatically generated by Aktualizr
|===================

// end::summary-table[]

NOTE: The "Fleet Root CA" is the one generated in step 1 of the procedure: link:./provision-with-device-credentials.adoc#use-a-hardware-security-module-hsm-when-provisioning-with-device-credentials[use a Hardware Security Module to provision with device credentials].
