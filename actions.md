## Garage (sota) tools

These tools also use libaktualizr, but only for common utility functions. They are focused specifically on dealing with OSTree objects. They originally lived in a separate repo, which is where the "sota_tools" name came from. The garage nomenclature refers to the historical name of our reference SaaS server, ATS Garage, before it was renamed HERE OTA Connect.
